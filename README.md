# Soar Builds

For binary builds of Soar you can get them in two places:

* [Official Releases](http://soar.eecs.umich.edu/articles/downloads/soar-suite)
* [Latest Successful Development Build](http://soar-jenkins.eecs.umich.edu/Nightlies/)
  * Note: If there isn't a build for your platform or if the 7zip archive is older than the others, the build failed.  You can check [here](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/branches) to see if it successfully built on all platforms.

Note: For the developmental builds, the non-scu and scu versions are equivalent.
