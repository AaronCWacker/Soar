# Soar Performance Graphs

Some performance statistics are calculated automatically using the Factorization Stress Tests.  You can see performance on a commit-by-commit basis either in [Performance.md](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/blob/development/Performance.md) or [here](http://soar-jenkins.eecs.umich.edu/Performance/). The raw data used to generate the graphs for each build can be found [here](http://soar-jenkins.eecs.umich.edu/Performance/).

Disclaimer: These are worst case tests.  Average performance is probably much higher.  In addition, these show that even in worst case, Soar beats its goal of 50 msec reactivity (in these tests, the max is ~30msec per decision).
